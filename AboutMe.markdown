![Profile-Image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Me.png)

My name is **Carter Brooke**, and Iâ€™m a **Game Programmer** with a passion for creating immersive, technically polished games. Currently, I work as an **Apprentice Programmer at Sumo Digital**, where Iâ€™m honing my technical expertise while drawing on my **Games Production degree** and **QA experience** at **Rockstar and Rare Ltd** to develop new and engaging experiences.

Games have been a lifelong passionâ€”not just as entertainment, but as an art form that brings people together and tells stories. From gameplay mechanics to rendering optimizations, I love tackling complex technical challenges and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to bring ideas to life, in the hopes of inspiring the next generation of creative, forward-thinking game developers.  

## Passion for Games & Development  

I thrive on the intersection of **technology and creativity**, always pushing to develop efficient, scalable, and engaging systems. Whether itâ€™s crafting gameplay mechanics, optimizing rendering pipelines, or building internal tools, I enjoy working on the technical foundations that make games run smoothly.  

## Professional Experience  

Over the years, I have worked across multiple disciplines in the games industry, giving me a **holistic understanding of development pipelines**. Before stepping into a programming role, I gained valuable experience in **QA at Rare and Rockstar Games**, where I worked in **multi-disciplinary, agile teams** alongside programmers, designers, and artists. This experience not only strengthened my ability to **identify, diagnose, and resolve complex issues** in AAA titles but also taught me the importance of **collaborative problem-solving and iterative development**.  

At **Sumo Digital**, I have been further refining my skills as a **programmer**, working closely with designers, artists, and fellow engineers in an **agile environment**. I thrive in **fast-paced, iterative development**, actively participating in **stand-ups, sprint planning, and cross-discipline collaboration** to ensure that creative ideas are realized with technical efficiency and scalability.  

## Technical Skills  

- **Game Programming** â€“ Experience with **C++**, **C#**, and **Python** for game development and tool creation.  

- **Engines & Frameworks** â€“ Proficient in **Unreal Engine 4/5** and **Unity**, with a solid understanding of **rendering pipelines** and **performance optimization**.  

- **Debugging & Optimization** â€“ Skilled in **RenderDoc, PIX, Intel VTune, and PlayStation Razor** for **profiling and improving performance**.  

- **Project & Version Control** â€“ Proficient with **Perforce, Git, and Azure DevOps**, ensuring smooth integration and workflow across teams.  

- **Continuous Integration & Automated Testing** â€“ Familiar with **CI/CD pipelines**, having worked with **TeamCity** in both QA and programming roles. At **Rare**, I gained insight into **test-driven development** and robust automated testing workflows. At **Sumo Digital**, I implemented an **automated screenshot test** as a **TeamCity build step**, generating an **HTML artifact** with build screenshots for validation.  

## Agile Development & Teamwork  

- **Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration** â€“ Experienced in working with **designers, artists, and fellow programmers** to develop and refine gameplay features.  

- **Agile & Scrum Methodologies** â€“ Comfortable in **Scrum-based teams**, contributing to **iterative development**, **feature refinement**, and **cross-discipline problem-solving**.  

- **QA & Development Synergy** â€“ Having worked in both **QA and programming**, I understand how to bridge the gap between **identifying issues** and **implementing technical solutions**, ensuring high-quality output throughout the development cycle.  

## Creative & Technical Mindset  

I thrive in **problem-solving scenarios**, whether it's optimizing rendering pipelines, developing robust gameplay systems, or creating internal tools to streamline workflows. My approach is **forward-thinking and adaptable**, always seeking to refine my skillset and stay ahead of industry trends.  

Beyond my professional work, I actively participate in **game jams**, using them as a platform to experiment with new mechanics, sharpen my coding skills, and collaborate with fellow developers.  

## Outside of Development  

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy:  
- **Gaming** â€“ A diverse taste, from **competitive multiplayer titles** like **League of Legends** and **Albion Online** to **immersive single-player experiences** such as the **Insomniac Spider-Man games**. I have a deep love for **roguelikes and roguelites**, with favorites including **Slay the Spire**, **Hades**, and **Balatro**. I also frequently return to **sandbox and simulation games**, enjoying the creativity of **Minecraft**, the emergent gameplay of **Project Zomboid**, and the complex automation of **Satisfactory**.
- **PC Building** â€“ A dedicated enthusiast, always keeping up with the latest hardware trends and helping others build high-performance rigs.  
- **Fitness & Football** â€“ Keeping both mind and body sharp by playing football regularly and training at the gym. I have represented both **Rare and Sumo Digital** at charity football events such as OneBigGame, for the charity **Special Effect**.
