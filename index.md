# Project Recoil 

**Group project**: Developed over three months as part of my Programming Apprenticeship at Sumo Digital, in partnership with Sheffield Wednesday.

- Developed in C++, with shaders in HLSL and Python for tools. 

- Co-developed a deferred renderer, using and modifying a proprietary C++ framework to interface with DirectX 11. 

- Designed and implemented a Render Callback system inspired by Frostbite’s RenderGraph. 

- Developed a GPU-accelerated, wind-driven foliage system. 

- Collaborated with Technical Artists on the Metal Snake implementation. 

- Played by Sheffield Wednesday fans during halftime at home matches. 

I co-developed a **deferred rendering pipeline**, leveraging a **proprietary C++ framework** to interface with DirectX 11 and implementing **custom HLSL shaders**. This demonstrated my ability to **balance performance and quality** while applying strong knowledge of rendering architecture and techniques. 

To improve the rendering pipeline’s flexibility, I designed a **Render Callback system**, allowing rendering commands to be structured into passes and processed as a graph. This modular approach streamlined workflows, reinforced my skills in software architecture, and made rendering more scalable. I helped in porting this system for re-use in another (unannounced) academy project. 

Another key contribution was the **wind-driven foliage system**, where I developed a **GPU-accelerated wind animation** method. By computing wind data on the CPU and applying **vertex shader transformations** with noise variation, I achieved realistic movement while maintaining high performance. I further optimized this by using **instanced rendering** and implementing punch-through transparency to avoid unnecessary forward-pass rendering. 

This project strengthened my ability to integrate technical solutions with artistic goals. Collaborating with Technical Artists, I helped implement the Metal Snake, ensuring a visually compelling result while maintaining performance constraints. Throughout the project, I honed my problem-solving, optimization, and teamwork skills, delivering a polished, high-performance rendering system used in a real-world interactive experience. 

# Unreal Engine 5 - Wave Function Collapse Tool

**Solo Project:** Developed and refined over a few weeks as part of my Programming Apprenticeship at Sumo Digital. 

- Developed as a reusable Unreal Engine plugin for seamless integration. 

- Implemented in C++ with functionality exposed to Blueprint. 

- Designed for both design-time and runtime use, offering maximum flexibility. 

- Includes a custom Editor tool and data asset to streamline user workflows. 

As part of my work in **Unreal Engine**, I developed a **procedural generation plugin** using the **Wave Function Collapse algorithm** to create tile-based levels. Built from the ground up, the tool was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing designers and programmers to generate levels both at runtime and within the editor. This project reinforced my ability to architect well-structured, reusable systems while ensuring a user-friendly workflow. 

Performance is a critical consideration in procedural generation, which led me to implement the c**ore functionality in C++** for efficiency. To make the tool more accessible across disciplines, I **exposed the logic to Blueprint via a Blueprint Function Library**, allowing designers to leverage the system without deep coding knowledge. Additionally, I developed a **custom data asset**, enabling users to define tile sets and constraints in a data-driven manner, improving ease of use and scalability. 

This project highlights my expertise in engine programming, tool development, and procedural generation, as well as my ability to create efficient, flexible systems that cater to multiple disciplines. It also demonstrates my understanding of performance optimization, scalable software architecture, and Unreal Engine’s plugin and tooling framework.

**Solo Project** – Developed to deepen my understanding of Unity and refine my C# skills under strict time constraints.

- **Unity Development** – Built my first complete project in Unity, significantly improving my proficiency with its workflows, physics system, and input handling.  
- **C# Programming** – Strengthened my understanding of C#, particularly in structuring gameplay logic and handling player interactions.  
- **Scalable & Reusable Code** – Applied **SOLID principles** and embraced **composition over inheritance**, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable gameplay systems.  
- **Time Management** – Successfully scoped, developed, and completed the game within the jam’s timeframe, balancing project scope with available time.  
- **Project Management** – Used **HacknPlan** for agile task tracking, ensuring steady progress toward the final submission.  

**Unified** was my entry into **Brackeys Game Jam 2021**, where I developed a cooperative-style platformer that fit the theme **"Stronger Together."** The game challenges two separated characters to overcome obstacles and reunite before time runs out.  

With limited time available, I focused on **achievable yet creative mechanics**, ensuring a variety of puzzles while keeping development manageable. To optimize workflow, I utilized **HacknPlan** for task tracking and incorporated **free Unity Marketplace assets** alongside my own art, allowing me to prioritize gameplay and programming.  

A key takeaway from this project was learning the value of **scalable and reusable code**. By applying **SOLID principles** and **favoring composition over inheritance**, I structured my gameplay systems in a way that made them **more modular, flexible, and maintainable**. This approach not only made development smoother during the jam but has also influenced how I approach system design in my later projects.  

This project was an invaluable **learning experience**, reinforcing my ability to **work independently, adapt quickly, and problem-solve under pressure**. It also solidified my understanding of Unity as a development tool, rounding out my experience with different engines.
